What is DDoS?
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyberattack where multiple devices are used to send a massive amount of traffic to a server, website, or network at the same time. The goal is to overwhelm the target’s resources so it becomes slow, unstable, or completely unavailable to legitimate users. These attacks are often carried out using botnets (networks of compromised devices) and are commonly used to disrupt services rather than to steal data.
